## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

### Environment Variable Management
- All sensitive data is managed through environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` files prevent accidental commits of sensitive files
- `.env.example` file provides template for required environment variables

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth integration with Google for secure authentication
- NextAuth.js for session management
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Secure session handling

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting (recommended for production)
- CORS configuration
- Secure HTTP headers

### Data Protection
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS in production)
- Secure database connections
- Environment-based configuration management

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables contain sensitive information and must be kept secure:

### Critical Secrets
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Used for encrypting NextAuth.js sessions
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth secret for Google authentication
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - API key for Perplexity AI services
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key
- `MONGODB_URI` - Database connection string (may contain credentials)

### API Keys
- `WEATHER_API_KEY` - Weather service API key
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID (less sensitive but should be protected)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
2. **Use `.env.example` as a template** - copy to `.env` and fill with real values
3. **Rotate secrets regularly** in production environments
4. **Use strong, randomly generated secrets** for NEXTAUTH_SECRET
5. **Limit API key permissions** to minimum required scope
6. **Enable 2FA** on all service accounts

### For Deployment
1. **Use environment variable injection** in production deployments
2. **Enable HTTPS** for all production traffic
3. **Implement rate limiting** on API endpoints
4. **Use secure headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies
6. **Monitor for exposed secrets** using tools like GitLeaks

### For Production
1. **Separate environment configurations** for dev/staging/production
2. **Use secrets management services** (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
3. **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive data
4. **Regular backup and recovery testing**
5. **Network security** (VPC, security groups, firewalls)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** the maintainers directly with details
3. **Provide** clear steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. **Allow time** for the vulnerability to be patched before public disclosure

### What to Include in Your Report
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if applicable)

- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested

## Dependency Security

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

- **Python dependencies**: Updated via `pip-audit` and Dependabot
- **Node.js dependencies**: Updated via `npm audit` and Dependabot
- **Docker base images**: Updated regularly to latest stable versions
